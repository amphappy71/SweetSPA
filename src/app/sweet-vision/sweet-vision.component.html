    <h4>The Late Steve Jobs once said:</h4>
  <div class="col-md-6 tms">
    <p>"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
       and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what
       you believe is great work. And the only way to do great
       work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet,
       keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart,
       you'll know when you find it."</p>

      For the majority of us, Steve’s quote is simple and valuable guidance.
      Inevitably, for all but the most privileged among us,
      work will not only fill a large portion of our lives,
      but  each day’s work is memorialized in scenes played out over supper tables,
      social gatherings, and social media across America nightly.
      Be it a big promotion, a raise, or possibly even a setback or failure,
      it is undeniable much of a ‘normal’ adult life revolves around work!
  </p>

      We are groomed from our very earliest days of Elementary School to work.
      While there are exceptions, by-in-large our education systems exist to
      prepare children to work as adults. ‘Normal’ people complete this journey
      along varying paths. The brightest and hardest working among us attend and
      graduate from the finest schools, and assume leadership positions as their
      work. At the other end of the spectrum we find adults working in skilled trades,
      or maybe service positions. As with most circumstances countless situations
      exist in between, but whether one is the CEO of a corporation, or ‘just’ the janitor,
      generally each draws a sense of pride from the work they are doing. That said, we could
      sum things up here, give old Steve an ‘atta boy’ for his brilliant quote, and get back to work!

      Before you do (return to work), I ask you to take a moment and consider your life if there was
      no work for you, or even any real opportunity to find work, and almost nobody cared if you worked,
      in fact almost everybody assumed you would never work.in fact almost nobody even knew you didn’t work.
      This is a reality for adults with a Cognitive Disability, and while we rarely (if ever) hear about their
      plight, this hole exists for 4.5% of the population between the ages of 18-64 (disabilitycompendium.org).
  </p>
  <p>
      It’s easy to understand how these adults are overlooked, after all if you don’t have an adult
      with a Cognitive Disability, why would you even give it a thought. Thankfully some organizations
      are actively trying to help, in fact as of 2016 thirty-six companies of varying sizes have employed,
      and continue to employ adults with Cognitive Disabilities. From the perspective of the employers
      these hires have almost resulted entirely in public success stories, and for the disabled adults
      and their families these jobs almost always result in pride, self-worth, excitement, and happiness.
      This I can personally vouch for. Specifically I have a cousin with Down Syndrome. Like any child in America,
      she was provided an education, and then school was done. Kim spent the next 15 years rarely leaving the house.
      She had no social life, she had no work life, and she became very depressed and withdrawn.
      Then a miracle happened, and the local McDonald’s made some positions available to adults with special needs,
      and my cousin Kim got her first job! The changes in Kim, as shared from my Aunt through tear filled eyes are
      impossible to miss or discount. All that which we garner (and take for granted) from working,
      was now available to Kim. Every aspect of her life improved drastically. She was happy, and engaged.
      She now had stories for the dinner table. She now had a life, and was excited to share it.

      While the efforts of McDonald’s and other businesses are commendable, they can only provide so many
      positions for adults with Cognitive Disabilities. Let’s be frank, a businesses first responsibility
      is the bottom line, and by definition any hire with a Cognitive Disability offers (at best) unique challenges,
      and a potential cut in productivity, and profits. So while it’s important to be thankful for, and recognize the
      efforts already being put forward, it’s unrealistic to ask or expect, them to do more. Considering a newly opened
      coffee shop in Maryland (see CNN Hero of the Year Any Wright) opened with seventeen disabled workers, it’s obvious
      a large need still exists.

      I mentioned before, most people are oblivious to the plight of these adults, and for quite a while I must confess I belonged to this group. What makes this even more stunning is the fact I have a child (son) with a Cognitive Disability (autism), and had no understanding of the value of work to him. Frankly I didn’t think he even understood the concept of work, so how could it even be possible he might need to work? Being the parents of ‘normal’ kids also, we have always treated Todd the same as his siblings when possible. To make a long story short Todd gets an allowance and has chores just like his siblings. Todd’s work ethic is like nothing I’ve ever witnessed personally or professionally. He loves his chores, and he dances with his allowance before putting in his piggy bank and checkbook. He recants his trials and tribulations about his chores nightly at the dinner table. This is remarkable to his Mother and I, as previously we had to force him to interact at the dinner table. Turns out once we gave Todd something to talk about...We cannot hardly shut him up. Incredibly the changes have impacted his entire personality for the better.

      Having witnessed this now via story, and personal experience, and given the understanding that traditional business can only help so much, I believe with some public, and corporate support we can provide thousands of safe, real jobs nationwide.

      The concept for Sweet T’s is simple. Provide safe jobs for adults with cognitive disabilities, by selling safe to handle, easy to ship, products to the public via a Web Store (T-Shirts, shoestrings, hats, etc), then let the ‘Crew’ write a “Thank you” letter and ship the product.

      The initial location is planned for Johns Creek, GA, and is to serve as a template for locations (determined by cost and interest) nationwide.

      Each location would employ a ‘Site Manager,’ with preference for these positions going to disabled veterans (disabled but not Cognitive Disability). Each ‘Site Manager’ will staff support positions with interns pursuing degrees to work with special needs individuals. Shifts for the Cognitive Disability workers will be short (4 hours or less), and worked out with the ‘Site Manager’ as needed.

      Sweet T’s will not be a traditional business in the sense ‘profit’ is the driving force. In fact by design some gross inefficiencies will be cooked into the process.
      While the idea of a non-profit is likely a better fit for this project, going that route would not provide real jobs at a real company for these individuals, potentially defeating the purpose of the project. I believe between product sales, and donations this company could provide jobs and opportunities for these adults for generations.
